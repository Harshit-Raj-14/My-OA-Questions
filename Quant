A field. 100 murderers. One bullet. 
'You are guarding 100 murderers in a field with a single bullet. If any murderer has a non-zero probability of surviving, he will attempt to escape. 
If a murderer is certain of death, he won't try. How do you stop them from escaping?'

ðŸ§  Most Candidates:
â€¢ Start calculating probabilities
â€¢ Try to determine optimal shooting strategy
â€¢ Consider game theory matrices
â€¢ Get lost in the mathematical weeds

ðŸ’¡ What Elite Candidates See:
The elegant solution requires zero calculations:
Don't shoot anyone. Simply announce you'll shoot randomly if anyone tries to escape. Since no one can have certainty of survival (the key constraint), and they only attempt escape with non-zero survival probability, no one will risk it.

This Question Tests:
â€¢ Can you spot critical information in a sea of distractions?
â€¢ Do you default to complexity or seek elegant solutions?
â€¢ Can you explain complex logic simply?
â€¢ Do you understand human behavior beyond the numbers?
