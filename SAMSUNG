Problem: From an integer array, choose a contiguous window ‘W1’ from left or right; the result is negative sum of ‘W1’ + positive sum of remaining elements. Maximize the result.
Solution: Kadane’s algorithm - running max.
- Passed all visible test case in 1.5 hrs
- Spent the next 1 hr optimizing my code.
- In the last 15 min, the invigilator confirmed that hidden test cases also passed.
- Finally, I took breath of relief.

2️⃣ Virtual Tech Interview:
- Taken by a Senior Engineer who asked a flood-fill based Medium problem. 
- Asked me to describe my SWC test problem and code its solution. 
- Later learned that Samsung does this to weed out folks who cheated in their SWC test.

If you solve LC 200. Number of Islands, you can solve this too.


3️⃣ Hiring Manager Interview
- Asked about my past projects at Amazon.
- Asked “Check if two linked lists are Intersecting”.
- Followed up with “Find the intersection point”. 
- Gave just the O(m + n) time complexity solutions.

If you solve LC 160. Intersection of Two LLs, you can solve both parts here.
