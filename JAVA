Differnece between abstraction and encapsulation?
Encapsulation hides variables or some implementation that may be changed so often in a class to prevent outsiders access it directly. They must access it via getter and setter methods.

Abstraction is used to hide something too, but in a higher degree (class, interface). Clients who use an abstract class (or interface) do not care about what it was, they just need to know what it can do.

We then transitioned into a detailed discussion on Kafka, covering areas like consumers, producers, topics, partitions, and its use cases. This segment involved several real-time problem-solving scenarios, such as:
Designing a system to process 15 trillion messages in real time
Diagnosing and addressing message delays of 3ms: possible reasons, recovery steps, and alerting measures to ensure customers remain unaffected.
Scaling strategies when the number of brokers is fixed.
Handling scenarios where, after a Kafka upgrade, services fail to connect. Questions included identifying potential issues, detecting such failures, and rolling back.
