Differnece between abstraction and encapsulation?
Encapsulation hides variables or some implementation that may be changed so often in a class to prevent outsiders access it directly. They must access it via getter and setter methods.

Abstraction is used to hide something too, but in a higher degree (class, interface). Clients who use an abstract class (or interface) do not care about what it was, they just need to know what it can do.
