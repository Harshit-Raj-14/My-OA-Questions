Why should we hire you?
This si actualy not my first time interviewing at google. I gav eonce before and at tha ttime I remebr in first itnerview I did not even understood the rpbolem and by end of it. i came up with a dnaky brute force but there wa snot evne time lef tto code.
I might did well in secodn and got to third but i idd not make the cutr.
But id din't say to myself that maybe i ma not just good enough. i have consistnetly worked hard each day to make myself capable to get one more chanc eto interivew this.
I have multiple offers waiitng for me, and my parnets dont even know. My friends and teachers telling me take this and go home and you cna try later.
And I think and so to myself that I am not done yet. I deserve better i can do better. And after that failure I haven't have a peaceful night.
And if you hire me you will not be hiring a random guy who solved one ranadom leetcode dsa problem. you will be hiring someone who did not give up and has worked hard to stand strong and try again and I promise you I am going to crack this interview and get this job no matter what.

To sum it up, I have the experience and capacity to do anything I have set my mind to and i beleive I cna immensely contriburt ena dwork witht he tema to acheive something better.
