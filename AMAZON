R1 : LC 127. Word Ladder
R2 : 
LC 863. All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree
GFG. Connect n ropes with minimum cost

 - Gave O(n) solution, then optimized using binary search to O(log n) and later to O(log(sqrt(m))).
R 3:
LC 76. Minimum Window Substring
- LC Hard; Smallest substring in ’s’ containing ’t’ as subsequence
