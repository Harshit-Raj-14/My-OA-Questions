In React, components are the building blocks of UI. Let's break down the key differences between Functional and Class Components:

👉 Functional Components:

✨ Plain JavaScript functions.
✨ Accept props as arguments and return JSX.
✨ No render() method used.
✨ Also known as Stateless components.
✨ Run from top to bottom and can't be kept alive after returning.

👉 Class Components:

✨ Require extending from React.Component.
✨ Have a render() method returning JSX.
✨ Also known as Stateful components.
✨ Utilize lifecycle methods like componentDidMount.
✨ Instantiated and can keep different lifecycle methods alive.


⚡️ Using Hooks ⚡️

Functional components support Hooks, which enable stateful logic. Example:

const [name, setName] = React.useState('');


🚧 Syntax Variation 🚧

Functional Component syntax is straightforward.
Class Component syntax includes a constructor for state management.

🌟 React offers flexibility with these two types of components, each serving its purpose depending on the specific requirements of your application! 🌟
