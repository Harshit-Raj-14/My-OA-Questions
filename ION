Round 1: Online Assessment
The initial round consisted of 20-22 MCQs (I don‚Äôt recall the exact number), covering:
Basic Aptitude questions
Basic DSA concepts
The questions were quite straightforward and manageable with practice.
Round 2: Virtual Interview
The interview was scheduled for the next day. Since it was my first interview, I was understandably nervous. To prepare, I sought advice from seniors who suggested focusing on puzzles and DSA problems.
 A helpful resource I used: https://lnkd.in/g8R-b6Zf
Here‚Äôs how the interview unfolded:

 üî¥ I initially gave an incorrect approach but later revised my solution.

3Ô∏è‚É£ DSA Question:
Find the maximum product of three elements in an array (which may include negative numbers).
