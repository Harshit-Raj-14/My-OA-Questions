INTERVIEW QUESTION LEETCODE GOOGLE TAGGED

📚 Detailed Tips to tackle each one:

1. DP ⏮️:
 - Topic wise prep
 - Solve at least 2 problems on all unique DP patterns.
 - All the patterns you need to cover -
 1. 1-D DP: Fibonacci, Coin Change
 2. 2D DP: Unique Paths, Minimum Path Sum
 3. MCM: Burst balloons, Optimal parenthesization
 4. Knapsack: 0/1 Knapsack, Subset Sum, Partition Equal Subset Sum
 5. LCS + LIS
 6. Interval DP: Like Non-overlapping Intervals, Maximum Earnings from Taxi
 7. String DP: Edit distance, regEx matching
2. Graph 📈:
 - Again, vast concept -> so divide and conquer.
 - Learn basic graph theory from any CS book/YT playlist.
 - Solve at least 2 problems on all Graph patterns -
 1. DSU
 2. Cycle Detection (DFS/Kahn/Topo Sort)
 3. MST (using Prims/Kruskal)
 4. Coloring nodes (Bipartite/M-coloring)
 5. Shortest Path (Djikstra’s/Bellmann-Ford/Floyd-Warshall)
3. Segment Trees 🌲:
 - These problems can mostly, also be solved using other DSA.
 - Such as: Merge Sort, Hashset/Multiset, DSU, Line Sweep and Offline queries.
 - Hence, 2 ways to deal with segment trees:
 1. Skip it and master solving Segment tree problems using all of the alternate DSA.
 2. Or master segment trees and use them to solve most problems that require O(n logn) TC.
4. Fenwick trees ☘️:
 - Similar to segment trees
 - Main difference - much smaller code - 10-15 lines!! 
 - Can give you the edge in a 45-min interview. 
 - If you chose to master segment trees, learn Fenwick trees as well.
5. Bit Manipulation 0️⃣/1️⃣:
 - A topic I struggled with throughout my college life.
 - Finally focused on it when got stumped in an interview.
 - My self-taught 3-step process that can make you a Bit Manipulation hero - 
 1. Know your operands: LEFT/RIGHT shift, XOR, AND, OR, NOT.
 2. Study their properties. For eg:
 - LEFT/RIGHT shift -> get a particular bit.
 - XOR -> find a single element when others exist twice.
 - AND/OR -> mask/unmask a number.
 3. Practice 5 problems on each property. Repeat.
